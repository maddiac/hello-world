# hello-world
first repository in github
Hi. I've tried learning Python a year ago, but stopped. I continued throughout the year to restart from the beginning of my Codecademy course to relearn, but I was unsuccessful.
Now I'm learning from the Odin Project, and so far I like it! I definitely appreciate the background the Intro. provides because it gave me a sense of what I'm learning. 
Oop, I thought I had already made a branch, lol. Here we go again...
